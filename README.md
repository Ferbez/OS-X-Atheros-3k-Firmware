## IOath3kfrmw, RehabMan fork's fork

Atheros 3k (AR3011) kernel extension for macOS - firmware uploader

Should work on Mojave (10.14), was tested only on Big Sur (11.0)


### What was changed

Not that much honestly - even though I wasted like two or three weeks trying to figure out what was wrong. Also I bundled firmware uploader with injector (IOath3kdevice) - it's not required, but will make on/off button in system preferences work.
